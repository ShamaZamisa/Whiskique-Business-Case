# Whiskique Business Case Study
# Project Overview

This project analyzes sales, profitability, shipping costs, and customer behavior for a pet retail business using Power BI.

The goal was to:

- Identify revenue and margin drivers

- Perform market basket analysis

- Provide actionable business recommendations

Key Metrics: 
  - Total Sales: $1.55M

  - Profit Margin: 27.82%
  - Baseline Shipping Cost: $385K

Key Insights: 

1️⃣ Category Performance

- Pet Food drove volume but had lower margins (~20%).

- Opportunity: Promote high-margin categories.

2️⃣ Shipping Optimization

- Using a What-If analysis:
