# Whiskique Business Case Study
# Project Overview
I will be analyzing e-commerce data from the company Whiskique, an ficticous online pet store. Whiskique's primary business goals are to:
1. Serve as many customers as possible.
2. Increase sales. We will do this by cross-selling a relevant product at Point-of-Purchase, as well as upselling a higher priced alternative or higher quantity of the product.
3. Reduce operating costs through shipment consolidation, package dimensions, weight, or shipping at a higher quantity.
The tools I leveraged are: 
- Power Query to clean the data and prepare it for modelling in Power BI
- DAX to perform calculations and queries on the data
- Power BI in order to model the data, establish table relationships  and ultimately create engaging dashboard style pages that contain insights to help Whiskique attain its business goals.
